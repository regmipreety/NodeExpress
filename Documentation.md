Promise
* The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value
Await
* The await operator is used to wait for a Promise. It can only be used inside an async function within regular JavaScript code; however it can be used on it own with JS modules

Async/Await: It allows you to write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner. Async doesn't have resolve or reject parameters. Everything after Await is placed in an event queue
* Async makes  function return a promise
* Await makes an async function wait for a promise
