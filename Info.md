* Asynchronous operations are tasks that are executed independently of the main program flow, allowing the program to continue running while waiting for these tasks to complete. This is crucial for non-blocking I/O operations, which include tasks like reading from or writing to a file, making network requests, querying a database, and more.

* Examples of Asynchronous Operations:
1. File I/O: Reading or writing files on the disk.
2. Network Requests: Making HTTP requests to APIs.
3. Database Operations: Querying or updating a database.
4. Timers: Using setTimeout or setInterval.
* Why Asynchronous Operations are Important:
1. Non-Blocking: Allows the program to continue executing other tasks instead of waiting for the operation to complete.
2. Performance: Improves performance and responsiveness, especially in I/O-bound and high-latency operations.
* Ways to Handle Asynchronous Operations in JavaScript:
Callbacks: Functions passed as arguments to other functions to be executed once an asynchronous operation completes.

* Synchronous (sync) operations are tasks that are executed sequentially, meaning each task must complete before the next one starts. In synchronous execution, the program waits for the current operation to finish before moving on to the next one. This is the traditional way of programming where each line of code is executed one after the other.

* Characteristics of Synchronous Operations:
1. Blocking: Each operation blocks the execution of subsequent operations until it completes.
2. Sequential Execution: Operations are performed one after another in a specific order.
3. Predictability: The flow of the program is easy to follow because it executes line by line.

<h3>When to Use Synchronous Operations</h3>
1. When the tasks are CPU-bound and quick to complete.
2. When writing simple scripts or small programs where blocking is not a concern.
3. When the predictability of execution order is crucial.

In summary, synchronous operations are executed in a linear and blocking manner, making them easy to follow and debug. However, they can lead to performance issues in I/O-bound or time-consuming tasks, which is where asynchronous operations become essential for improving responsiveness and efficiency.

<h3>Callback function </h3>
A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is intended to be called or executed later within that function. In simpler terms, it's a way to provide a mechanism for handling asynchronous operations or events in JavaScript.

Here are some key points about callback functions:

Function Passed as an Argument: In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, which means they can be passed as arguments to other functions.

Execution Context: When a function accepts a callback, it invokes (calls) the callback function at some point during its execution, usually to notify completion of a task or to handle an event.

Handling Asynchronous Operations: Callbacks are commonly used to manage asynchronous operations like reading files, making HTTP requests, or handling user input. Once the asynchronous operation completes, the callback function is called with the result.

Error Handling: Callbacks can also handle errors. Typically, the first parameter of a callback function is reserved for an error object or status, allowing the caller to handle errors appropriately.
